# AWS WAF Rules Visualization Tool

## Overview
This tool provides a visual representation of AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) ACL (Access Control List) rules, helping security engineers and developers better understand and manage their WAF configurations. It fetches ACL data from AWS and displays the rules flow based on their priorities, making it easier to analyze and troubleshoot complex WAF setups.

## Key Features
- **Visual Rule Flow**: Displays WAF rules in a hierarchical flow diagram based on priority
- **Version Comparison**: Compare different versions of ACL configurations to track changes
- **Real-time AWS Integration**: Directly fetches current WAF configurations from your AWS account
- **Interactive Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for navigating complex rule sets
- **Rule Priority Visualization**: Clear representation of rule execution order
- **Configuration Analysis**: Helps identify potential conflicts or redundancies in rule sets

## Technical Details
The application connects to AWS using the AWS SDK to fetch WAF ACL configurations. It processes this data to create an interactive visualization showing:
- Rule priorities and relationships
- Rule actions (Allow, Block, Count)
- Rule conditions and criteria
- Rule version history

## Use Cases
- Security audit and compliance reviews
- WAF configuration troubleshooting
- Change management and tracking
- Training and documentation
- Rule optimization and refinement

## Requirements
- AWS Account with appropriate IAM permissions
- Access to AWS WAF configurations
- Modern web browser for visualization
